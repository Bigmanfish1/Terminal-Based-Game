# Survival Puzzle Game

###Overview

This is a proof of concept puzzle survival game developed in C++ for the terminal. The game features a map with floors, walls, doors, a playable character, lamps, and an exit.

-Different objects on the map: walls, floors, doors, lamps, player, and exit

-Message queue for displaying in-game messages

-Lighting system using a watered-down version of recursive ray tracing for lamps

-Game ends when the player reaches the exit
